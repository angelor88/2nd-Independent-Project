      <h1>Bikram Yoga</h1>
      <p><em>Bikram Yoga<em> is a system of yoga that Bikram Choudhury synthesized from traditional hatha yoga techniques. It became popular in the <a href="http://bikramyogasetauket.com/bikram-yoga/history-of-bikram-yoga" target="blank">early 1970s</a>. All Bikram Yoga Beginning Series classes run for 90 minutes and consist of the same series of 26 postures, including two breathing exercises.Bikram Yoga is a hot yoga style, and is ideally practiced in a room heated to 35–42 °C (95–108 °F) with a humidity of 40%. All official Bikram classes are taught by Bikram-certified teachers, who have completed nine weeks of training endorsed by Choudhury. Bikram-certified teachers are taught a standardized dialogue to run the class, but are encouraged to develop their teaching skills the longer they teach. This results in varying deliveries and distinct teaching styles</p>
